# Contributing to Magenda

## Pull requests

All changes to `main` go through pull requests. Direct pushes are blocked.

1. Create a branch off `main`, named `<type>/<kebab-case-description>`, with `feature/`, `fix/`,
   `chore/`, `docs/` or `tests/` as the type. `plan/` branches hold a plan document while its work
   is open (see [Decisions, plans and ADRs](#decisions-plans-and-adrs)) and are never PR'd.
2. Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR. PRs merge with a merge commit, not a squash, so
   every commit message on your branch ends up in `main`'s history. Write each one for that
   audience.
3. Describe *why* the change is needed, not just what it does.
4. PRs require review and approval from a code owner (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) before merging.
5. A user-visible change adds a line under `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## [Unreleased]` heading in the same
   PR. Never open a concrete `## [X.Y.Z]` heading on a feature branch; only the PR that prepares a
   release does that — see [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md#release-notes-come-from-changelogmd).
6. Before opening a PR, work through the
   [definition of done](docs/coding-and-testing-guidelines.md#definition-of-done) and fill in the
   PR template's checklist. [`docs/testing-policy.md`](docs/testing-policy.md) says which checks CI
   runs and which you run or dispatch yourself.

### Release integration branches (`releases/*`)

`releases/*` (for example `releases/1.2-dev`) is a long-lived integration branch, cut from `main`
only when a batch of work for the next release has to accumulate somewhere other than `main`
while `main` stays frozen for a prior release's remaining blockers. It is a deliberate exception,
not a standing convention: while one exists, branches fork from it and PR into it with the normal
naming, and the `releases/*` branch is deleted once it merges back into `main` in one PR.

`releases/*` is protected like `main` (`scripts/update_branch_protection.py --branch <name>
apply`), and every workflow push trigger scoped to `main` for a test or lint job also lists
`"releases/**"`. Upload triggers stay tag-only.

## Decisions, plans and ADRs

Three kinds of document, three lifecycles. The full rules, template and index are in
[`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md):

- **Plans** (what we are about to do) are temporary: a GitHub issue, or a `docs/*-plan.md` while
  its work is open. They are deleted when the work lands.
- **ADRs** (`docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`: why it is this way, what was rejected) are permanent and frozen
  once accepted. Change your mind with a new ADR that supersedes the old one; never rewrite an
  accepted ADR's body, and never put implementation progress in one.
- **Reference docs** (`docs/*.md`, this file) describe today's behavior and link to ADRs for the
  *why* rather than retelling it.

**Retiring a plan requires extracting its decisions first.** The PR that deletes a plan document
adds or amends an ADR for every decision the plan made that meets the ADR bar in
[`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md#when-a-decision-needs-an-adr), or says in its
description that the plan made none.

The same applies to a decision made anywhere else (a PR thread, an issue, a reference doc): if it
meets the bar, it gets an ADR in the same PR. ADRs link to issues, PRs, commits and source files,
never to a plan document, which will not outlive it.

## Releasing

Cutting a release is a git tag, not a commit; everything else follows from the tag push. The whole
process is [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md).

## Issues

Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests. Include the app version and build number
(shown in the app's About section), the device and iOS version, and steps to reproduce. Do not
report a security vulnerability in a public issue — follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Code style

- Swift 6, SwiftUI, Apple's frameworks first. A new third-party package gets an ADR saying why.
- Logic goes in `AppCore/`, views in `App/` (ADR 0007).
- No comments unless the *why* is non-obvious; match the surrounding code.
- The full conventions are
  [`docs/coding-and-testing-guidelines.md`](docs/coding-and-testing-guidelines.md).

## Running from source

```bash
swift test --package-path AppCore             # anywhere with a Swift toolchain
python3 scripts/pre_release_check.py          # the blocking gate; on macOS it also runs the app's tests
xcodegen generate && open Magenda.xcodeproj
```
