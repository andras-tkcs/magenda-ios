"""Print one version's section out of CHANGELOG.md.

This is what makes the GitHub Release body and the changelog the same text: `.github/workflows/
build.yml`'s `github-release` job runs this once, after the archive and the TestFlight upload
succeeded, and uses the output as the release body. The notes are written once, reviewed in the pull request
that writes them, and tag day involves no writing (ADR 0005).

It reads a version *out of* the changelog and never determines one. The git tag is the only
version source (ADR 0004); nothing may parse CHANGELOG.md to find out what is being built.

Stdlib only, so the release jobs can run it before installing anything.

It exits non-zero, deliberately, in three cases, each of which would otherwise ship wrong notes
from a green build:

  * the version has no section (a stable tag whose notes nobody wrote);
  * the version has two sections (a section opened early, then `[Unreleased]` renamed on top of
    it: only the first half would render);
  * `## [Unreleased]` still has entries (the release PR fixed the heading but left the cycle's
    entries stranded above it). `--allow-unreleased` renders anyway, for reading a section by hand
    mid-cycle; nothing in .github/workflows/ passes it.

Pre-release tags have no section of their own (Keep a Changelog folds them into the version they
lead to), so the workflow only runs this for the stable channel.

Examples:
    python3 scripts/changelog_section.py 1.2.0
    python3 scripts/changelog_section.py v1.2.0 --changelog path/to/CHANGELOG.md
